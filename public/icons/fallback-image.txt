Fallback Image for Offline Use

This file should be replaced with an actual PNG image file named "fallback-image.png" with dimensions of at least 200x200 pixels.

The image should have:
1. A light purple background (#f5f3ff)
2. Text saying "Afbeelding niet beschikbaar" (Image not available)
3. Subtitle saying "Controleer uw internetverbinding" (Check your internet connection)
4. A simple icon indicating offline status

This image will be used as a fallback when the application is offline and cannot load images from the network.
