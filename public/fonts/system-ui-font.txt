Fallback Font for Offline Use

This file should be replaced with an actual WOFF2 font file named "system-ui.woff2".

The font should be:
1. A system UI font that closely resembles the default font used in the application
2. Optimized for web use (WOFF2 format)
3. Include basic Latin characters, numbers, and common symbols

This font will be used as a fallback when the application is offline and cannot load fonts from the network.

Recommended approach:
- Use a subset of a common system font like Arial, Helvetica, or Roboto
- Convert it to WOFF2 format using a tool like FontSquirrel's Webfont Generator
- Ensure the file size is small (ideally under 30KB) for efficient offline caching
