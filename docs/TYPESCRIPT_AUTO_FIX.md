# TypeScript Auto-Fix System

The TypeScript Auto-Fix System is a powerful tool designed to automatically fix TypeScript errors in the FibroGuardian codebase. It uses pattern recognition and intelligent error analysis to identify and fix common TypeScript issues.

## Features

- **Intelligent Error Detection**: Analyzes TypeScript errors and identifies patterns
- **Automated Fixes**: Applies fixes for common TypeScript errors
- **Learning Capability**: Improves over time by learning from previous fixes
- **Persistent Database**: Stores fixes in a database for future reference
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Logs all fixes and errors for review
- **CI/CD Integration**: Can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines

## Available Scripts

The following npm scripts are available for running the TypeScript Auto-Fix System:

```bash
# Run the TypeScript fixer once
npm run fix:types

# Run the TypeScript auto-fix script (Windows)
npm run autofix:types

# Run the TypeScript auto-fix script (Unix/Linux/macOS)
npm run autofix:types:unix

# Run the specific error fixer
npm run autofix:specific

# Run the enhanced specific error fixer
npm run autofix:enhanced

# Run the unified auto-fix system (includes all fixers)
npm run autofix:unified

# Run all auto-fix scripts (including TypeScript)
npm run autofix:all
```

## How It Works

The TypeScript Auto-Fix System works by:

1. Running the TypeScript compiler to identify errors
2. Analyzing the errors and extracting patterns
3. Applying fixes based on known patterns and previous fixes
4. Saving the fixes to a database for future reference
5. Logging the results for review

## Types of Fixes

The system can fix a wide range of TypeScript errors, including:

- **Property Access Errors**: Adding interface extensions for missing properties
- **Type Assignment Errors**: Fixing type assignments and adding type assertions
- **Parameter Type Errors**: Adding type annotations to parameters
- **Null Checks**: Adding null checks to possibly undefined objects
- **Missing Properties**: Adding missing properties to types
- **Unused Variables**: Prefixing unused variables with underscore
- **Spread Types**: Adding type assertions to spread types
- **Missing Exports**: Fixing import statements for missing exports
- **Return Types**: Adding return types to functions
- **And many more!**

## Scheduled Execution

The TypeScript Auto-Fix System can be run as a scheduled task or as part of a CI/CD pipeline. The following scripts are available for scheduled execution:

- `scripts/cron/auto-fix-typescript.sh` (Unix/Linux/macOS)
- `scripts/cron/auto-fix-typescript.bat` (Windows)

These scripts will:

1. Run the TypeScript fixer
2. Check if there are still TypeScript errors
3. Log the results for review

## Configuration

The TypeScript Auto-Fix System uses the following configuration files:

- `scripts/data/error-patterns.json`: Contains patterns for common TypeScript errors
- `scripts/data/typescript-fixes.json`: Stores fixes applied by the system

## Extending the System

To add new fix patterns:

1. Identify a common TypeScript error pattern
2. Add the pattern to `scripts/data/error-patterns.json`
3. Add a fix function to `scripts/fix-typescript.js`

## Best Practices

- Run the TypeScript Auto-Fix System regularly to keep the codebase clean
- Review the logs to ensure the fixes are correct
- Add new patterns as needed to improve the system
- Use the system as part of your CI/CD pipeline to catch errors early

## Limitations

The TypeScript Auto-Fix System is not perfect and may not be able to fix all TypeScript errors. Some errors may require manual intervention, especially those related to complex type relationships or architectural issues.

## Troubleshooting

If the TypeScript Auto-Fix System is not working as expected:

1. Check the logs for errors
2. Ensure the TypeScript compiler is installed and working
3. Verify that the configuration files exist and are valid
4. Try running the system with the `--debug` flag for more detailed output

## Type Assertions Fixer

The TypeScript Auto-Fix System includes a specialized Type Assertions Fixer that automatically corrects common syntax errors related to TypeScript type assertions. This fixer specifically targets issues with:

- Incorrect type assertions in destructuring patterns (e.g., `const { id, ...updateData as Record<string, unknown> } = data;`)
- Type annotations in function parameters (e.g., `if (error: unknown)`)
- Type annotations in method calls (e.g., `.eq('id', id: unknown)`)
- And other common TypeScript syntax errors

### How It Works

The Type Assertions Fixer uses a set of regular expressions to identify and fix common syntax errors. For example, it will convert:

```typescript
const { id, ...updateData as Record<string, unknown> } = data;
```

to the correct syntax:

```typescript
const { id, ...updateData } = data;
const typedUpdateData = updateData as Record<string, unknown>;
```

### Running the Type Assertions Fixer

You can run the Type Assertions Fixer using the following npm script:

```bash
npm run autofix:assertions
```

The Type Assertions Fixer is also automatically run as part of the CI/CD pipeline and the `autofix:all` script.

## Advanced Type Fixer

The TypeScript Auto-Fix System includes an Advanced Type Fixer that uses machine learning and advanced pattern recognition techniques to identify and fix complex TypeScript errors that couldn't be fixed by the basic TypeScript Auto-Fix System or the Type Assertions Fixer.

### How It Works

The Advanced Type Fixer works by:

1. Analyzing TypeScript errors and extracting patterns
2. Grouping similar errors together
3. Generating intelligent fixes based on the error patterns
4. Learning from successful fixes to improve future runs

The Advanced Type Fixer can handle a wide range of complex TypeScript errors, including:

- Property access errors (TS2339)
- Type assignment errors (TS2322)
- Parameter type errors (TS7006)
- Null and undefined errors (TS2531, TS2532)
- Argument type errors (TS2345)
- Argument count errors (TS2554)
- Property suggestion errors (TS2551)
- Missing property errors (TS2741)
- Return statement errors (TS2366)

### Running the Advanced Type Fixer

You can run the Advanced Type Fixer using the following npm script:

```bash
npm run autofix:advanced
```

The Advanced Type Fixer is also automatically run as part of the CI/CD pipeline and the `autofix:all` script.

### Learning Capabilities

The Advanced Type Fixer includes a sophisticated learning system that:

1. Analyzes errors that couldn't be fixed
2. Identifies patterns in these errors
3. Generates new fix strategies
4. Adds these strategies to the error patterns database
5. Provides detailed recommendations for improving type safety

### Configuration

The Advanced Type Fixer uses the following configuration files:

- `scripts/data/advanced-error-patterns.json`: Contains patterns for complex TypeScript errors
- `scripts/data/advanced-fixes-history.json`: Stores fixes applied by the system

## Auto-Learning System

The TypeScript Auto-Fix System also includes an intelligent Auto-Learning System that automatically analyzes TypeScript errors that couldn't be fixed by the auto-fix system, identifies patterns, and adds new fix strategies to the error-patterns.json file.

### How It Works

The Auto-Learning System works by:

1. Analyzing TypeScript errors that couldn't be fixed by the auto-fix system
2. Identifying patterns in these errors
3. Creating new fix strategies based on these patterns
4. Adding these strategies to the error-patterns.json file
5. Logging all learning activities for review

### Running the Auto-Learning System

You can run the Auto-Learning System using the following npm script:

```bash
npm run autofix:learn
```

The Auto-Learning System is also automatically run as part of the CI/CD pipeline and the `autofix:all` script.

### Learning Capabilities

The Auto-Learning System can learn from various types of TypeScript errors, including:

- Property access errors (TS2339)
- Type assignment errors (TS2322)
- Parameter type errors (TS7006)
- Unused variable errors (TS6133)
- Missing export errors (TS2614)
- Missing named export errors (TS2724)
- Unknown type errors (TS18046)

For each error type, the system analyzes the error message, extracts relevant information, and creates a new fix strategy if the error occurs frequently enough.

### Configuration

The Auto-Learning System uses the following configuration options:

- `MIN_OCCURRENCES`: The minimum number of occurrences of a pattern to consider it for auto-learning (default: 3)
- `ERROR_PATTERNS_PATH`: The path to the error patterns file (default: 'scripts/data/error-patterns.json')
- `TYPESCRIPT_FIXES_PATH`: The path to the TypeScript fixes file (default: 'scripts/data/typescript-fixes.json')
- `LOGS_DIR`: The directory where learning logs are stored (default: 'logs')

### Logs

The Auto-Learning System logs all learning activities to the logs directory. Each log file contains information about the new patterns that were added, including:

- The pattern key
- The pattern description
- The pattern solution
- Examples of code that triggered the pattern

## Unified Auto-Fix System

The TypeScript Auto-Fix System now includes a Unified Auto-Fix System that integrates all auto-fix components into a single, intelligent system. This system automatically fixes TypeScript errors, learns from previous fixes, and continuously improves over time.
