            This PR contains automated fixes for code quality issues.

            Changes include:
            - ESLint auto-fixes
            - TypeScript improvements (using the TypeScript Auto-Fix System)
            - Import organization
            - Unused code removal
            - Type safety enhancements

            The TypeScript Auto-Fix System has automatically fixed common TypeScript errors by:
            - Adding missing type annotations
            - Fixing interface extensions
            - Adding null checks
            - Fixing import statements
            - Addressing unused variables
            - And more!

            The Auto-Learning System has analyzed remaining TypeScript errors and:
            - Identified new error patterns
            - Added new fix strategies to the error-patterns.json file
            - Made the system smarter for future runs
            - Logged all learning activities for review

            The Type Assertions Fixer has automatically fixed:
            - Incorrect type assertions in destructuring patterns
            - Type annotations in function parameters
            - Type annotations in method calls
            - And other common TypeScript syntax errors

            The Advanced Type Fixer has:
            - Used machine learning to identify complex error patterns
            - Generated intelligent fixes for difficult TypeScript errors
            - Added new patterns to the error database for future runs
            - Provided detailed recommendations for improving type safety

            The Specific Error Fixer has:
            - Targeted and fixed known TypeScript errors in specific files
            - Addressed issues with exported member names
            - Fixed "use client" directive placement
            - Corrected event handler type issues
            - Resolved null/undefined checks
            - Fixed React component issues

            The Enhanced Specific Error Fixer has:
            - Provided more comprehensive fixes for TypeScript errors
            - Fixed event handler type issues with proper React types
            - Improved "use client" directive placement
            - Added optional chaining for null/undefined checks
            - Fixed import statement issues
            - Resolved type conversion problems
            - Added proper type assertions
            - Fixed component-specific issues
