# Code Quality Issues Detected

The Auto-Fix System has detected code quality issues that could not be automatically fixed.

## Summary

The quality gate has failed, indicating that there are still issues in the codebase that need to be addressed manually.

## Details

### TypeScript Issues

TypeScript errors may include:

- Type mismatches
- Missing type definitions
- Incorrect interface implementations
- Unused variables or imports
- Missing return types

### ESLint Issues

ESLint warnings may include:

- Code style inconsistencies
- Potential bugs
- Performance issues
- Accessibility issues
- Security vulnerabilities

## Recommended Actions

1. Run the following commands locally to see detailed error messages:

   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   npx eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx,.js,.jsx
   ```

2. Use the auto-fix tools to resolve as many issues as possible:

   ```bash
   npm run fix:all
   ```

3. For issues that cannot be automatically fixed, review the error messages and fix them manually.

4. Consider running the memory leak detection tool to identify potential memory leaks:

   ```bash
   npm run check:memory-leaks
   ```
